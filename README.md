Pseudo number generator, stream cipher and tripleDES


### Pseudo number generator

* __Usage__ via terminal
* Go into `/pseudo_number_generator/src` and compile LCG.java
* You have __2 ways of executing__ the pseudo number generator:
  * type in terminal `java LCG <number>`, e.g. `java LCG 8`
    * this will call the generator with the start value "8"
  * type in terminal `java LCG`
    * this will call the generator with a randomly generated BigInteger as start value
* For __further notes__ see notes.md in the folder pseudo_number_generator
